# AirBnB Clone Project


This project is being undertaken by The ALX School as part of their curriculum

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to create a simplified version of the AirBnB website.

## Phase 1: Development of the Command Interpreter

The primary task in this initial phase is to build a command interpreter that facilitates the management of AirBnB objects.

# What is a Command Interpreter?

In essence, a command interpreter resembles the functionality of a shell, but it's tailored to a specific use-case. For this project, the command interpreter enables us to handle various tasks related to our project objects:

0. **Creation of New Objects:** This involves generating new instances of objects like Users or Places.
1. **Retrieval of Objects:** The interpreter should allow us to retrieve objects from different sources, such as files or databases.
2. **Object Operations:** We'll be able to perform operations on objects, such as counting objects or computing statistics.
3. **Object Attribute Updates:** The interpreter will facilitate the modification of object attributes.
4. **Object Deletion:** It will be possible to remove objects from the system.

By accomplishing this phase, we'll lay a solid foundation that will be employed and expanded upon in the subsequent project phases, which include HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

## The Usage of the console


```bash
    $ ./console.py
    (hbnb) help

    Documented commands (type help <topic>):
    ========================================
    EOF  help  quit

    (hbnb) 
    (hbnb) 
    (hbnb) quit
$
```


**also can be used in non-interactive mod**


```bash
    $ echo "help" | ./console.py
    (hbnb)

    Documented commands (type help <topic>):
    ========================================
    EOF  help  quit
    (hbnb) 
    $
    $ cat test_help
    help
    $
    $ cat test_help | ./console.py
    (hbnb)

    Documented commands (type help <topic>):
    ========================================
    EOF  help  quit
    (hbnb) 
    $
```
